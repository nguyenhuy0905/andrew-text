## Code of conduct

Read [CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Style

- Generally, following clang-tidy should be sufficient. For code formatting,
following clang-format should also be sufficient.
- A tab is 4 spaces.
- Document code using Doxygen-style documents.
- If you are writing a custom page, write in Doxygen syntax also (like that in
[this example](./docs/pages/index.dox)).
